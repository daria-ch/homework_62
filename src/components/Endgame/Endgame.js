                    <p style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}><b>Avengers: Endgame </b>is a 2019 American superhero film based
                        on the
                        Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt
                        Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2012's The Avengers, 2015's Avengers: Age of
                        Ultron, and 2018's Avengers: Infinity War, and the twenty-second film in the Marvel Cinematic
                        Universe (MCU). It was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and
                        Stephen McFeely, and features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark
                        Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie
                        Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow,
                        and Josh Brolin. In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and their allies attempt to
                        reverse the damage caused by Thanos in Infinity War.

                        The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 2, but Marvel later
                        removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and
                        McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the
                        story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters. Filming
                        began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting
                        back-to-back with Infinity War, and ended in January 2018. Additional filming took place in the
                        Metro and Downtown Atlanta areas, New York, Scotland, and England. The story revisits several
                        moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise as
                        well as music from previous films. The official title was revealed in December 2018. With an
                        estimated budget of $356 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made.

                        Avengers: Endgame was widely anticipated, and Disney backed the film with Marvel's largest
                        marketing campaign. It premiered in Los Angeles on April 22, 2019, and was theatrically released
                        in the United States on April 26. The film received praise for its direction, acting, musical
                        score, action sequences, visual effects, and emotional weight, with critics lauding its
                        culmination of the 22-film story. It grossed nearly $2.8 billion worldwide, surpassing Infinity
                        War's entire theatrical run in just eleven days and breaking numerous box office records,
                        including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time.</p>
                    <h3 style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>Plot</h3>
                    <p style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
                        Twenty-three days after Thanos used the Infinity Gauntlet to disintegrate half of all life in
                        the universe,[N 1] Carol Danvers rescues Tony Stark and Nebula from deep space and returns them
                        to Earth, where they reunite with the remaining Avengers—Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Thor,
                        Natasha Romanoff, and James Rhodes—and Rocket. Locating Thanos on an otherwise uninhabited
                        planet, they plan to retake and use the Infinity Stones to reverse "the Snap", but Thanos
                        reveals he destroyed the Stones to prevent their further use. Enraged, Thor decapitates Thanos.

                        Five years later, Scott Lang escapes from the quantum realm.[N 2] At the Avengers compound, he
                        explains to Romanoff and Rogers that he experienced only five hours while trapped, instead of
                        years. Theorizing the quantum realm could allow time travel, the three ask Stark to help them
                        retrieve the Stones from the past to reverse Thanos's actions in the present. Stark refuses,
                        thinking of his wife, Pepper Potts, and daughter, Morgan, but relents after thinking back to the
                        death of Peter Parker. Stark and Banner, who has since merged his intelligence with the Hulk's
                        strength, build a time machine. Banner notes changing the past does not affect their present;
                        any changes instead create branched alternate realities. He and Rocket visit the Asgardian
                        refugees' new home in Norway—New Asgard—to recruit Thor, now overweight and drinking heavily,
                        despondent over his failure to stop Thanos. In Tokyo, Romanoff recruits Clint Barton, now a
                        violent vigilante following Thanos's disintegration of his family.

                        Banner, Lang, Rogers, and Stark travel to New York City in 2012.[N 3] Banner visits the Sanctum
                        Sanctorum and convinces the Ancient One to give him the Time Stone. At Stark Tower, Rogers
                        retrieves the Mind Stone, but Stark and Lang's attempt to steal the Space Stone fails, allowing
                        2012 Loki to escape with it. Rogers and Stark travel to S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters in 1970, where
                        Stark obtains an earlier version of the Space Stone and encounters his father, Howard, while
                        Rogers steals Pym Particles from Hank Pym to use in returning to the present. Meanwhile, Rocket
                        and Thor travel to Asgard in 2013, extracting the Reality Stone from Jane Foster[N 4] and
                        retrieving Thor's hammer, Mjolnir. Nebula and Rhodes travel to Morag in 2014 and steal the Power
                        Stone before Peter Quill can.[N 5] Rhodes returns to the present with the Power Stone, but
                        Nebula becomes incapacitated when her cybernetic implants link with those of her past self.
                        Through this connection, 2014 Thanos learns of his future success and the Avengers' attempts to
                        undo it. He decides to rebuild the whole universe so no one will remember what he has done. 2014
                        Thanos captures present Nebula and sends 2014 Nebula to the present in her place. Barton and
                        Romanoff travel to Vormir in 2014, where the Soul Stone's keeper, the Red Skull, reveals it can
                        only be acquired by sacrificing someone they love. Romanoff sacrifices herself, allowing Barton
                        to obtain the Soul Stone.

                        Reuniting in the present, the Avengers place the Stones into a gauntlet Stark has created.
                        Banner, the most resistant to the Stones' gamma radiation, is chosen to wield the gauntlet and
                        reverses the disintegrations. Meanwhile, 2014 Nebula uses the time machine to transport 2014
                        Thanos and his warship to the present, where he attacks the Avengers' compound looking for the
                        Stones. Present Nebula convinces 2014 Gamora to betray Thanos but fails to convince 2014 Nebula
                        and is forced to kill her. Confronted by Stark, Thor, and a Mjolnir-wielding Rogers, Thanos
                        outmatches them and summons his army from his warship. Stephen Strange arrives with other
                        sorcerers, the restored Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, the Ravagers, and the armies of
                        Wakanda and Asgard to fight Thanos and his army. Danvers arrives and destroys Thanos' warship,
                        but Thanos overpowers her and seizes the gauntlet. Stark steals the Stones and uses them to
                        disintegrate Thanos and his army, at the cost of his own life.

                        Following Stark's funeral, Thor appoints Valkyrie as the new ruler of New Asgard and joins the
                        Guardians of the Galaxy. Rogers returns the Infinity Stones and Mjolnir to their original
                        timelines and remains in the past to live with Peggy Carter. In the present, an elderly Rogers
                        passes his shield and mantle on to Sam Wilson.
