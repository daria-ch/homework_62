                    <p style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}><b>Avengers: Age of Ultron</b> is a 2015 American superhero film
                        based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers, produced by Marvel Studios and
                        distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2012's The Avengers and
                        the eleventh film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was written and directed by
                        Joss Whedon and features an ensemble cast that includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark
                        Ruffalo, Chris Evans,
                        Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul
                        Bettany, Cobie Smulders, Anthony Mackie, Hayley Atwell, Idris Elba, Stellan Skarsgård, James
                        Spader, and Samuel L. Jackson. In the film, the Avengers fight Ultron, an artificial
                        intelligence obsessed with causing human extinction.

                        The sequel was announced in May 2012, after the successful release of The Avengers. Whedon, the
                        director of the first film, was brought back on board in August and a release date was set. By
                        April 2013, Whedon had completed a draft of the script, and casting began in June with the
                        re-signing of Downey. Second unit filming began in February 2014 in South Africa with principal
                        photography taking place between March and August 2014. The film was primarily shot at
                        Shepperton Studios in Surrey, England, with additional footage filmed in Italy, South Korea,
                        Bangladesh, New York City, and various locations around England. While in post-production, the
                        film was converted to 3D and over 3,000 visual effects shots were added. With an estimated net
                        production budget of $365 million, it is the second most expensive film ever made.

                        Avengers: Age of Ultron premiered in Los Angeles on April 13, 2015, and was released in the
                        United States on May 1, 2015, in 3D and IMAX 3D. The film received generally positive reviews
                        from critics and grossed over $1.4 billion worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film
                        of 2015 as well as the fifth-highest-grossing film at the time. Two sequels, Avengers: Infinity
                        War and Avengers: Endgame, were released in April 2018 and April 2019, respectively.</p>
                    <h3 style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>Plot</h3>
                    <p style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
                        In the Eastern European country of Sokovia, the Avengers—Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Thor, Bruce
                        Banner, Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton—raid a Hydra facility commanded by Baron Wolfgang von
                        Strucker, who has been experimenting on humans using the scepter previously wielded by Loki.
                        They encounter two of Strucker's test subjects—twins Pietro, who has superhuman speed, and Wanda
                        Maximoff, who has telepathic and telekinetic abilities—and apprehend Strucker, while Stark
                        retrieves Loki's scepter.

                        Stark and Banner discover an artificial intelligence within the scepter's gem, and secretly
                        decide to use it to complete Stark's "Ultron" global defense program. The unexpectedly sentient
                        Ultron, believing he must eradicate humanity to save Earth, eliminates Stark's A.I. J.A.R.V.I.S.
                        and attacks the Avengers at their headquarters. Escaping with the scepter, Ultron uses the
                        resources in Strucker's Sokovia base to upgrade his rudimentary body and build an army of robot
                        drones. Having killed Strucker, he recruits the Maximoffs, who hold Stark responsible for their
                        parents' deaths by his company's weapons, and goes to the base of arms dealer Ulysses Klaue in
                        Johannesburg to obtain Wakandan vibranium. The Avengers attack Ultron and the Maximoffs, but
                        Wanda subdues them with haunting visions, causing Banner to turn into the Hulk and rampage until
                        Stark stops him with his anti-Hulk armor.[N 1]

                        A worldwide backlash over the resulting destruction, and the fears Wanda's hallucinations
                        incited, send the team into hiding at a safe house. Thor departs to consult with Dr. Erik Selvig
                        on the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination, while Nick Fury arrives and encourages
                        the team to form a plan to stop Ultron. In Seoul, Ultron uses Loki's scepter to enslave the
                        team's friend Dr. Helen Cho. They use her synthetic-tissue technology, vibranium, and the
                        scepter's gem to craft a new body. As Ultron uploads himself into the body, Wanda is able to
                        read his mind; discovering his plan for human extinction, the Maximoffs turn against Ultron.
                        Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton find Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures
                        Romanoff.

                        The Avengers fight amongst themselves when Stark and Banner secretly upload J.A.R.V.I.S.—who is
                        still operational after hiding from Ultron inside the Internet—into the synthetic body. Thor
                        returns to help activate the body, explaining based on his vision that the gem on its brow is
                        the Mind Stone, one of the six Infinity Stones, the most powerful objects in existence. This
                        "Vision" and the Maximoffs accompany the Avengers to Sokovia, where Ultron has used the
                        remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift a large part of the capital city skyward,
                        intending to crash it into the ground to cause global extinction. Banner rescues Romanoff, who
                        awakens the Hulk for the battle. The Avengers fight Ultron's army while Fury arrives in a
                        Helicarrier with Maria Hill, James Rhodes and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to evacuate civilians. Pietro
                        dies when he shields Barton from gunfire, and a vengeful Wanda abandons her post to destroy
                        Ultron's primary body, which allows one of his drones to activate the machine. The city
                        plummets, but Stark and Thor overload the machine and shatter the landmass. In the aftermath,
                        the Hulk, unwilling to endanger Romanoff by being with her, departs in a Quinjet, while Vision
                        confronts and seemingly destroys Ultron's last remaining body.

                        Later, with the Avengers having established a new base run by Fury, Hill, Cho, and Selvig, Thor
                        returns to Asgard to learn more about the forces he suspects have manipulated recent events. As
                        Stark leaves and Barton retires, Rogers and Romanoff prepare to train new Avengers: Rhodes,
                        Vision, Sam Wilson, and Wanda.

                        In a mid-credits scene, Thanos, dissatisfied by the failures of his pawns, dons a gauntlet[N 2]
                        and vows to retrieve the Infinity Stones himself.
