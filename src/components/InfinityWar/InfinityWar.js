                    <p style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}><b>Avengers: Infinity War</b> is a 2018 American superhero film
                        based on
                        the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by
                        Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2012's The Avengers and 2015's
                        Avengers: Age of Ultron, and the nineteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). It was
                        directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and
                        features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris
                        Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Don Cheadle, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman,
                        Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright,
                        Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldana, Josh Brolin, and Chris Pratt. In the film, the Avengers and the
                        Guardians of the Galaxy attempt to prevent Thanos from collecting the six all-powerful Infinity
                        Stones as part of his quest to kill half of all life in the universe.

                        The film was announced in October 2014 as Avengers: Infinity War – Part 1. The Russo brothers
                        came on board to direct in April 2015, and a month later Markus and McFeely had signed on to
                        write the script for the film, which draws inspiration from Jim Starlin's 1991 comic book The
                        Infinity Gauntlet and Jonathan Hickman's 2013 comic book Infinity. In 2016, Marvel shortened the
                        title to Avengers: Infinity War. Filming began in January 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in
                        Fayette County, Georgia, with a large cast consisting mostly of actors reprising their roles
                        from previous MCU films, including Brolin as Thanos. The production lasted until July 2017,
                        shooting back-to-back with a direct sequel, Avengers: Endgame. Additional filming took place in
                        Scotland, the Downtown Atlanta area, and New York City. With an estimated budget of $316–400
                        million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made.

                        Avengers: Infinity War held its world premiere on April 23, 2018, in Los Angeles, and was
                        released in the United States on April 27. Brolin's performance was praised, as was the
                        emotional weight of the story, the visual effects, and action sequences, but the film was
                        criticized for relying on previous MCU films for its story. It was the fourth film and the first
                        superhero film to gross over $2 billion worldwide, breaking numerous box office records. It
                        became the highest-grossing film of 2018 and the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time both
                        worldwide and in the United States and Canada. The film's visual effects were nominated at the
                        91st Academy Awards, 24th Critics' Choice Awards, and 72nd British Academy Film Awards. The
                        sequel, Avengers: Endgame, was released in April 2019.</p>
                    <h3 style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>Plot</h3>
                    <p style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
                        Having acquired the Power Stone, one of the six Infinity Stones, from the planet Xandar, Thanos
                        and his lieutenants—Ebony Maw, Cull Obsidian, Proxima Midnight, and Corvus Glaive—intercept the
                        spaceship carrying the survivors of Asgard's recent destruction.[N 1] As they extract the Space
                        Stone from the Tesseract, Thanos subdues Thor, overpowers Hulk, and kills Loki. Thanos also
                        kills Heimdall after he sends Hulk to Earth using the Bifröst. Thanos and his lieutenants
                        depart, destroying the ship.

                        Hulk crash-lands in the Sanctum Sanctorum in New York City, reverting to the form of Bruce
                        Banner. He warns Stephen Strange and Wong about Thanos's plan to kill half of all life in the
                        universe, and they recruit Tony Stark. Maw and Obsidian arrive to retrieve the Time Stone from
                        Strange, drawing the attention of Peter Parker. Maw is unable to take the Time Stone due to an
                        enchantment and captures Strange instead. Stark and Parker sneak aboard Maw's spaceship while
                        Wong stays behind to guard the Sanctum.

                        In Edinburgh, Midnight and Glaive ambush Wanda Maximoff and Vision in order to retrieve the Mind
                        Stone, which is in Vision's forehead. Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Sam Wilson rescue them
                        and they take shelter with James Rhodes and Banner at Avengers Compound. Vision asks Maximoff to
                        destroy himself and the Mind Stone to keep Thanos from retrieving it, but Maximoff refuses.
                        Rogers suggests they travel to Wakanda, which he believes has the resources to remove the Stone
                        without destroying Vision.

                        The Guardians of the Galaxy respond to a distress call from the Asgardian ship and rescue Thor,
                        who surmises that Thanos is currently going after the Reality Stone, which is in the possession
                        of the Collector on Knowhere. Rocket and Groot accompany Thor to Nidavellir, where they and
                        Eitri create Stormbreaker, a battle-axe capable of killing Thanos. On Knowhere, Peter Quill,
                        Gamora, Drax, and Mantis find Thanos with the Reality Stone already in his possession. Thanos
                        kidnaps Gamora, his adopted daughter, who reveals the Soul Stone is on Vormir in order to save
                        her captive adopted sister, Nebula, from torture. On Vormir, the Stone's keeper, Red Skull,
                        tells Thanos that he can only acquire it by sacrificing someone he loves. Thanos kills Gamora,
                        earning the Stone.

                        Nebula escapes captivity and asks the remaining Guardians to meet her at Thanos's destroyed
                        homeworld, Titan. Stark and Parker kill Maw and rescue Strange. Landing on Titan, they meet
                        Quill, Drax, and Mantis. Strange uses the Time Stone to view millions of possible futures,
                        seeing only one in which Thanos loses. The group forms a plan to subdue Thanos and remove the
                        Infinity Gauntlet, which he uses to house the Stones. Thanos appears and justifies his plans as
                        necessary to ensure the survival of a universe threatened by overpopulation. Nebula arrives soon
                        after, and helps the others subdue Thanos until she deduces that Thanos has killed Gamora.
                        Enraged, Quill attacks Thanos, allowing him to break the group's hold and overpower them. Stark
                        is seriously wounded by Thanos, but is spared after Strange surrenders the Time Stone to Thanos.

                        In Wakanda, Rogers reunites with Bucky Barnes before Thanos's army invades. The Avengers,
                        alongside T'Challa and the Wakandan forces, mount a defense while Shuri works to extract the
                        Mind Stone from Vision. Hulk refuses to fight after losing to Thanos, so Banner fights in
                        Stark's Hulkbuster armor. Thor, Rocket, and Groot arrive to reinforce the Avengers; Midnight,
                        Obsidian, and Glaive are killed and their army is routed, but Shuri is unable to complete the
                        extraction of the Mind Stone from Vision before Thanos arrives to retrieve it. Maximoff destroys
                        the Mind Stone and Vision, but Thanos uses the Time Stone to reverse her actions. He rips the
                        repaired Mind Stone from Vision's forehead, killing him. Thor severely wounds Thanos with
                        Stormbreaker, but Thanos activates the completed Gauntlet by snapping his fingers. He then
                        teleports away.

                        Half of all life across the universe disintegrates, including Barnes, T'Challa, Groot, Maximoff,
                        Wilson, Mantis, Drax, Quill, Strange, and Parker, as well as Maria Hill and Nick Fury, although
                        Fury is able to transmit an emergency signal on a modified pager before turning to dust.[N 2]
                        Stark and Nebula remain on Titan while Banner, M'Baku, Okoye, Rhodes, Rocket, Rogers, Romanoff,
                        and Thor are left on the Wakandan battlefield. Meanwhile, Thanos watches a sunrise on a peaceful
                        planet.
