                        American superhero film based on the Marvel
                        Comics superhero team of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt
                        Disney
                        Studios Motion Pictures.[N 1] It is the sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The
                        film
                        was written and directed by Joss Whedon and features an ensemble cast that includes Robert
                        Downey
                        Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner as the
                        titular Avengers team, alongside Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsgård,
                        and
                        Samuel L. Jackson. In the film, Nick Fury, director of the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D., recruits
                        Tony
                        Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner, and Thor to form a team that must stop Thor's brother Loki
                        from
                        subjugating Earth.

                        The film's development began when Marvel Studios received a loan from Merrill Lynch in April
                        2005.
                        After the success of the film Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel announced that The Avengers would be
                        released in July 2011. With the signing of Johansson in March 2009, the film was pushed back for
                        a
                        2012 release. Whedon was brought on board in April 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by
                        Zak
                        Penn. Production began in April 2011 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, before moving to Cleveland,
                        Ohio,
                        in August and New York City in September. The film was converted to 3D in post-production.

                        The Avengers premiered at Hollywood's El Capitan Theatre on April 11, 2012, and was released in
                        the
                        United States on May 4, 2012. The film received praise for Whedon's direction and screenplay,
                        visual
                        effects, action sequences, acting, and musical score, and garnered numerous awards and
                        nominations
                        including Academy Award and BAFTA nominations for achievements in visual effects. It set or tied
                        numerous box office records, including the biggest opening weekend in the United States and
                        Canada.
                        The Avengers grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide and became the third-highest-grossing film of
                        all
                        time, as well as the highest-grossing film of 2012. It is the first Marvel production to
                        generate $1
                        billion in ticket sales. In 2017, it was featured as one of the 100 greatest films of all time
                        in
                        Empire magazine's poll of The 100 Greatest Movies.

                        Three sequels, titled Avengers: Age of Ultron, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame,
                        were
                        released in May 2015, April 2018, and April 2019, respectively.</p>
                    <h3 style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>Plot</h3>
                    <p style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
                        The Asgardian Loki encounters the Other, the leader of an extraterrestrial race known as the
                        Chitauri. In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract,[N 2] a powerful energy source of unknown
                        potential, the Other promises Loki an army with which he can subjugate Earth. Nick Fury,
                        director of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., and his lieutenant Agent Maria Hill arrive at a
                        remote research facility during an evacuation, where physicist Dr. Erik Selvig is leading a
                        research team experimenting on the Tesseract. Agent Phil Coulson explains that the object has
                        begun radiating an unusual form of energy. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a
                        wormhole, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki takes the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave
                        Selvig and a few other agents, including Clint Barton, to aid him in his getaway.

                        In response to the attack, Fury reactivates the "Avengers Initiative". Agent Natasha Romanoff is
                        sent to Kolkata to recruit Dr. Bruce Banner to trace the Tesseract through its gamma radiation
                        emissions. Coulson visits Tony Stark to have him review Selvig's research, and Fury approaches
                        Steve Rogers with an assignment to retrieve the Tesseract.

                        In Stuttgart, Barton steals iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes
                        a distraction, leading to a brief confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with
                        Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., Thor, his adoptive brother,
                        arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a
                        confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft
                        carrier, the Helicarrier. Upon arrival, Loki is imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to
                        locate the Tesseract.

                        The Avengers become divided, both over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D.
                        plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons as a deterrent against hostile
                        extraterrestrials. As the group argues, Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the
                        Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the
                        Hulk. Stark and Rogers work to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's
                        rampage. Romanoff reluctantly fights Barton, and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind
                        control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and ejecting Thor from the airship, while the Hulk
                        falls to the ground after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet. Fury uses Coulson's death to
                        motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply
                        defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as
                        ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract, in conjunction with a device Selvig built, to open a
                        wormhole above Stark Tower to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.

                        Rogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, and Thor rally in defense of New York City, the wormhole's
                        location. Banner arrives and transforms into the Hulk, and together the Avengers battle the
                        Chitauri while evacuating civilians. The Hulk finds Loki and beats him into submission. Romanoff
                        makes her way to the wormhole generator, where Selvig, freed from Loki's mind control, reveals
                        that Loki's scepter can be used to shut down the generator. Meanwhile, Fury's superiors from the
                        World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at Midtown
                        Manhattan. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri
                        fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on
                        Earth. Stark's suit loses power, and he falls back through the wormhole just as Romanoff closes
                        it. Stark goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves him from crashing into the ground. In the
                        aftermath, Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, while Fury expresses confidence that
                        the Avengers will return if and when they are needed.

                        In a mid-credits scene, the Other confers with his master[N 3] about the failed attack on Earth.
